# M2-assignment-
Engineering next generation Natural Killer cells to withstand Reactive oxygen species  and hypoxia in solid tumors.

This git-hub rep contains the references used for the M2 assignmnet set by Professor Nikolai Windbichler at Imperial College London for the Mres Systems and Synthetic biology program.

Also, present here is the code I wrote to model the interactions between the components of the gene circuit and how they respond to ROS. 

I will upload the project proposal here after marking is complete.
